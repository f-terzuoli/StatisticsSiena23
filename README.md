# StatisticsSiena23

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks with exercises/examples presented during the course Statistical Treatment of Data held at University of Siena for the XXXVIII cycle of PhD in Experimental Physics.
The notebook can be run in Colab by clicking on the below badge.

**NB**: Notebooks still to be refined and expanded

Currently available notebooks:
- ```exponential_MLE```: exercise on the exponential distribution, studying the Likelihood, MLE, Score, Fisher's Information and loss of information due to truncation or binning
- ```Expo_ConfidenceIntervals```: computing Confidence Intervals with various ordering (increasing, decreasing, LR) - checking coverage
- ```HypothesisTest```: a small exercise on building a MLP test and studying its power
